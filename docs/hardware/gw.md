#Gateway

![hero](/img/gw.jpg)

The bluz gateway is a fully packaged solution for people to deploy products. It works the same way as the gateway shield,
acting as a bridge from Bluetooth LE to the internet. This allows you to place the most power-hungry portion of your deployment in
a central location with a constant power source, then place many battery powered bluz boards wherever you may need.

The gateway pairs an nrf51822 working in central mode with a Particle P1. This provides both the WiFi and BLE portions in
one compact package. The device can be powered from any USB wall charger.

The gateway is encased in a high quality injection molded plastic case. This case can be customized and branded for larger
orders if you would like to incoroprate it into your product. If you would like to know more about using the gateway in your
product, please contact us at hello@bluz.io
